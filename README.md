# Earth-Defence
A simple game protecting earth from an alien invasion


You may only use JS / CSS / HTML for this task and no frameworks or libraries. You can use sessions. The whole program should be written in one single file and may be either procedural or object oriented. It should be possible to place the file anywhere within a website and for it to be run in a browser. 

Create a simple text only game with a single button that hits a random alien from an invasion fleets. Each time the button is pressed, an alienp is hit and its points reduced. Once its points have gone to zero the alien dies and cannot be hit again. The screen shows the state of all the aliens after each hit. 
The game is over when all aliens have died. You should be able to start a new game once the game is over. 
You should be able to solve this in under 150 lines including comments and any more than that is a sign you have over complicated the problem. You can use basic html and css to tidy up the output, but the solution should be simple text and a button rather than any styled UI. 

You start the game with the following wasps. 

## 1 x Mothership
* 80 Hit Points  
* Loses 7 hit points every time it is hit  
* All wasps die if the queen is killed 

## 5 x bombers
* Each one starts with 68 hit points  
* Each one Loses 10 hit points each time it is hit 

## 8 x fighters
* Each starts with 60 hit points  
* Each loses 12 hit points each time it is hit.
